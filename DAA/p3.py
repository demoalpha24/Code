# Time Complexity:
#- **Sorting the items based on value-to-weight ratio**: \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of items.
#- **Filling the knapsack**: \(O(n)\), since we iterate through the sorted list of items and possibly take fractions.

#Thus, the overall time complexity is:\[ O(n \log n) \]

# Space Complexity:
#- The space complexity is \(O(n)\) because we store the list of \(n\) items and their value-to-weight ratios.

#So, the space complexity is:\[ O(n) \]
